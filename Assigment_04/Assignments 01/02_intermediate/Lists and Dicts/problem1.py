# Problem #1: List Practice
# Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

# def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.

# Print the length of the list.

# Add 'mango' at the end of the list. 

# Print the updated list.

def main():
    #furits list
    fruit_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple']
    
    #adding mango at the end of list
    fruit_list.append('mango')
    
    #print the updated list
    print(fruit_list)
